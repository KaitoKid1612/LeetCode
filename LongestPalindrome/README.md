# 2131. Longest Palindrome by Concatenating Two Letter Words
# Difficulty: Easy
# You are given an array of strings words. Each element of words consists of two lowercase English letters.
# You need to find the longest palindrome that can be created by concatenating two-letter words from the array.
# If you can create such a palindrome, return the length of the longest palindrome. Otherwise, return 0.
# A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward.
# Example 1:
# Input: words = ["lc","cl","gg"]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: One longest palindrome is "lcggcl" with length 6.
# Example 2:
# Input: words = ["ab","ty","yt","lc","cl","ab"]
# Output: 8
# Explanation: One longest palindrome is "tyyt" with length 4.
# Example 3:
# Input: words = ["cc","ll","xx"]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: One longest palindrome is "cc" with length 2.
# Constraints:
# 1 <= words.length <= 10^5
