# IsPalindrome

## Problem Statement
You are given a string `s`. Determine if the string is a palindrome, meaning it reads the same forwards and backwards.
## Example
```Example 1:
> Input: s = "racecar"
> Output: true
> Explanation: The string "racecar" reads the same forwards and backwards.
```

```Example 2:
> Input: s = "hello"
> Output: false
> Explanation: The string "hello" does not read the same forwards and backwards.
```
